# fokker-planck-based-spike-rate-models

## Note: the code is currently in working state (beta version), a final release is expected in April 2017.

Implementations of spike rate models derived from networks of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire models:

(1) Numerical solution of the mean-field Fokker-Planck (FP) equation using a finite volume method with Scharfetter-Gummel flux approximation.
(2) Low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODE) derived from the spectral decomposition of the FP operator. 
(3) Low-dimensional ODE based on a cascade of two linear filters and a nonlinearity determined from the FP equation and semi-analytically fitted.

Furthermore: precalculation codes for the quantities involved in (2) and (3).
