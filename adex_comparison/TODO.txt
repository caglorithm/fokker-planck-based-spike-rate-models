Moritz:
* add spectralsolver here as methods_spectra.py
* change h5 file usage (name changed to _noref.h5)

Josef:
* change h5 file usage (name changed to _noref.h5)
* maybe add ipython notebooks for better relation to paper?

Fabian:
* rename spec2m to spec2 -- similarly for the simple version (spec2_simple)
* make example scripts for situations as in fig1 and fig5 (e.g., runmodels.py runmodels_fig1.py / runmodels_fig5a.py / runmodels_fig5b.py)?

All:
* cleanup the code
* improve documentation
